Make sure the plugin package you want to upload is structured like this:

~~~ .no-highlight
plugin.zip
└── plugin/
    ├── file-1.txt
    ├── file-2.txt
    ├── file-3.txt
    ├── file-4.txt
    └── …
~~~

You need to add a root folder as a wrapper for all of your plugin files, and then you have to give a name for the `ZIP` file with the same name as the root folder name.
