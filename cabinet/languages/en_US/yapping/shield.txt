Make sure the shield package you want to upload is structured like this:

~~~ .no-highlight
shield-name.zip
 └── shield-name/
     ├── file-1.txt
     ├── file-2.txt
     ├── file-3.txt
     ├── file-4.txt
     └── …
~~~

You need to add a root folder as a wrapper for all of your shield files, and then you have to name the `ZIP` file with the same name as the root folder name.

After that, you can activate the shield through the [configuration manager]({{url.manager}}config "Configurations").
